# personal_scripts
These are various scripts I have created to make some tasks easier. There
aren't many here now, but I will be adding to them as I need them. If
you find any of them useful, feel free to grab them and use them.

Each script will have a "fancy info box" giving some background
information about why I created the script. If relevant, I will give some
information on how to use the script other than using `./${script_name}`.


== Why a README instead of a README.md ==
Because I don't see a need to use MarkDown for a simple README. MarkDown
can be great for some stuff, but not so much for a plain-text README.
